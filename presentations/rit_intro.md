# Me
I joined almost 5 months ago in the Imaging Applications team and right now I primarily work on managing our OMERO environments for image data management. 

My previous experience is in computer science and single cell data analysis in a lab specializing in neurodevelopment and cancer microenvironments. I used a lot of the same tools there as we use or support here, like R, Docker, cloud platforms

I'm originally from Neenah, WI but now I live and work from just outside Philadelphia. I wish I could say I cared enough about sportsball to care whether the Eagles won the superbowl.

If y'all ever want to talk about non-work stuff, I spend a lot of my time swing dancing or playing board games.
