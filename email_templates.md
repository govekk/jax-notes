Hi ,

I just created a new OMERO user for you in the [] group. If you have any questions about using OMERO, we have a few knowledge article tutorials online, along with a PDF version I've attached to this email.

Welcome,

Hi all, we are running an Intro to OMERO workshop Oct 24 & 31, 1-4pm ET.

Workshop will be held remotely via Zoom, and registration is open currently on Workday: https://www.myworkday.com/thejacksonlaboratory/learning/course/1e62ca10bbbf10016484245baa130000

# OMERO workshop setup
​
Hi everyone,

We’re very pleased that you’ll be attending OMERO training on Tue Oct 24 & Tue Oct 31 from 1-4pm on Zoom. General information and a schedule are available on the (workshop website)[linktoworkday]. This is the link to the (Zoom meeting)[linktoZoom]:

IMPORTANT: To participate in this training, you’ll need to install software on your laptop. Please do this before the workshop. You can follow the instructions below for software installation:

Fiji and OMERO
The workshop will require an installation of Fiji on the local machine with the OMERO plugin. 

Fiji: https://fiji.sc/

OMERO.imagej plugin: See these (installation instruction)[https://omero-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fiji/docs/installation.html]. 

VPN
Please connect to Global Protect VPN if you plan to be off campus during the training.

Set up your workspace
You will be learning by doing along with the instructors. To do this, you will need to have both the window for the tool you will be learning about (OMERO, Fiji, etc..) and the window for the video conference client open. In order to see both at once, we recommend using one of the following set up options: 

Two monitors: If you have two monitors, plan to have OMERO open on one monitor and the video conferencing software on the other.

Two devices: If you don't have two monitors, do you have another device (tablet, smartphone) with a medium to large sized screen? If so, try using the smaller device as your video conference connection and your larger device (laptop or desktop) to follow along with the tool you will be learning about.

Divide your screen: If you only have one device and one screen, practice having two windows (the video conference program and one of the tools you will be using at the workshop) open together. How can you best fit both on your screen? Will it work better for you to toggle between them using a keyboard shortcut? Try it out in advance to decide what will work best for you.
